### Welcome

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Center for Inter-American Policy and Research](http://cipr.tulane.edu) at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/). I study comparative politics and political methodology. I received my PhD from the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2021.

Here, you will find repositories associated with my research and teaching projects.

You can find more about me and my work at https://gustavodiaz.org/
