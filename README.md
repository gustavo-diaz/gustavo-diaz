### Welcome


I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.northwestern.edu) at [McMaster University](https://www.northwestern.edu). I teach courses on statistics, statistical programming, and computational social science.

My research develops standards to navigate research design tradeoffs in the social sciences, with focus on causal inference and computational social science. My substantive work applies these ideas to questions in comparative politics and political behavior.

Here, you will find repositories associated with my research and teaching projects.

You can find more about me and my work at https://gustavodiaz.org/
